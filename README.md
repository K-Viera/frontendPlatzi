## React Curriculum vitae
1. I modify some test to be relative to my information, for example the languajes, the original test are set to found more that 2 items, but as i only have 2 languajes y modify it to have 2 or more, this same happens in Skills and Academic.
2. I also change the data.json to be more relevant with the structure I already create before.
3. For the fourth task I also had to modify the test because when I consume the API I create all the items recursively with the map property every time I use and array and as I used function components the first time it loads the props all the info are null so it doesn't load the items.

## Troubleshooting
1. When I tried to execute the projet with nodejs v18 I get the error [ERR_OSSL_EVP_UNSUPPORTED](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69394632/webpack-build-failing-with-err-ossl-evp-unsupported) so I had to downgrade to v16.3.0 with [nmv](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
